# CapgeminiCodingExcercise
UNDER DEVELOPMENT - A coding exercise for Capgemini Software Factory

Website created for the recruitment task and learning of the Vue.js framework. It implements simple functionality - you can drag tasks from the field at the top and distribute them to three users.

Used Technologies:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js, libraries - vue-draggable.js.

How to use:
Download all three files to your computer and open index.html with any browser. The site requires internet access, because it uses external graphics and Vue.js libraries.

Future functionalities:
- saving the current status to Session Storage - thanks to this, the given tasks will not disappear after reloading the browser.

- Professional user interface

- Mobile version

- a form that allows you to add your own tasks

- maybe something more :)
